            <p>Chandrayaan-3 <em>Moon Landing </em>sucessful </p>
            <p>India took a giant leap on Wednesday evening as the ISRO's mooncraft,  <i></i> Chandrayaan-3 soft landed on Moon's south polar region, making it the first country to achieve this milestone.5 <i></i> Tag</p>
            <p> <b>On August 1, 2023, Chandrayaan-3 was inserted in a translunar orbit, and on August 5, 2023, the insertion was confirmed to be successful</b> </p>
            <p>India's Moon mission Chandrayaan-3 scripted history by successfully landing on the lunar surface at 6:04 pm on August 23. <strong>With the Lander accomplishing a 'soft landing' on the Moon's south pole, India becomes the only country to have ever done so.</strong></p>
            <p>This is <mark> Best of luck on Chandrayaan 3's journey. </mark></p>
